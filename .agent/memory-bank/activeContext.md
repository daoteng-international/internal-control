# Active Context

## Current Focus
The current focus is on **initializing the project documentation** and ensuring the standard Memory Bank structure is in place.

## Recent Changes
-   Created `.agent/memory-bank/` directory.
-   Created `productContext.md` and `systemPatterns.md`.
-   Created `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`, and `task.md`.

## Active Tasks
-   [x] Initialize Memory Bank
-   [ ] Verify project runs locally (Next Step)
-   [ ] Define detailed requirements for each module (Contracts, Cases, etc.)

## Next Steps
- Trigger Cloud Build for `dt-internal-control`.
- Set up Firebase Security Rules for `cases`.
- Implement Auth flow.

## Open Questions
-   Do we have existing database schemas or API definitions?
-   Are there specific design systems or UI libraries beyond Tailwind?
