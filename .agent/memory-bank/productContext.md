# Product Configuration

## Problem Statement
Managing internal controls, contracts, cases, and customer data is often scattered across different systems or files. There is a need for a centralized, web-based dashboard to track these entities efficiently within the organization.

## Core Value
**Centralized Internal Control System**: Provides a unified interface for managing:
-   **Announcements**: Internal communication.
-   **Cases**: Tracking internal control incidents or tasks.
-   **Contracts**: Legal document management.
-   **Customers**: Client relationship data.
-   **Documents**: General file repository.
-   **History**: Audit logs and historical records.

## Success Metrics
-   User ability to CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) entities in all modules.
-   Clear audit trails for actions (History).
-   Responsive and accessible UI for internal staff.
